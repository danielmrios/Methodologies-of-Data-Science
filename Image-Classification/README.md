# Image Classification Project

Developing an image classification algorithm that classifies images into one of at least two categories.

## Analysis

We used a Pokemon image dataset to train a model to classify between the 3 different Eevee evolutions; Flareon, Jolteon, and Vaporeon.

Analysis involved loading data, image classification pre-processing, and developing logistic regression and neural network models.
