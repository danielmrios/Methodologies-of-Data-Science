## Seattle Weather Project

We will use data science methodology to determine whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than New York, NY. 

The data is sourced from National Centers for Environmental Information using the NOAA climate data source tool: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND
