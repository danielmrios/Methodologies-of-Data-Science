# Education Inequality Project

This project addresses the inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. 

Here we will focus on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process. Is school performance predicted by socioeconomic factors?

## Data
The primary data set is the EdGap data set from EdGap.org. This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. 

Data: EdGap_data.xlsx

The secondary data set is basic information about each school from the National Center for Education Statistics.
